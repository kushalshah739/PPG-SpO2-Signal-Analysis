# PPG-SpO2-Signal-Analysis
 Pulse oximetry and blood pressure are important biomedical signals which are repeatedly checked and monitored in a medical environment. Pulse oximetry, and in turn oxygen saturation (Sp02) levels (which is the main data point measured by pulse oximetry)  can provide information on; the efficiency of pulmonary gas exchange, adequacy of alveolar ventilation, blood-gas transport, and tissue oxygenation.
